# Cryptosquare

#### By **Chris Crow * Skye Nguyen**

## Description

A classic method for composing secret messages is called a square code.

In this method, the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle) and the entire message is downcased.
